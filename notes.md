# examples
- parse a recursive data structure
    - not json!
- compare parser combinator version to a regex-based version for the same data
    - 3/9/1959 + 62 years - 4 weeks + 2 days
    - 1959-03-09 + 62 years - 4 weeks + 2 days
- do both! the recursive example demonstrates something you can't do in regex

# to library or not
- should i use a library or hack my own?
    - you wouldn't write your own regex tool, would you? so use a combinator library
    - write your own for the "what are they" portion but use a library for the "how to use them" portion

# problems
- use function declarations instead of function expressions
- function declarations are hoisted
